# CS121 Project 5 - File IO

The purpose of this lab is to practice file input and output, data conversion using stringstreams, and reading CSV data. We are given the following file:

```
1, 2, this
3, 3, is
8, 1, a
2, 4, lot
2, 1, of
4, 2, fun
```  

We are then given the task of breaking the data into variables where the numbers are ints and the text is a string. We then add the two numbers together and print the string that many times. For example:

```
input:

1, 2, this

output:

this, this, this
```
